# Nexmo Quickstart Examples for Python

Quickstarts also available for: [Java](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-java-quickstart), [.NET](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-dotnet-quickstart), [Node.js](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-node-quickstart), [PHP](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-php-quickstart),  [Ruby](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-ruby-quickstart)

The purpose of the Quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused
on one goal. For example, sending an SMS, handling an incoming SMS webhook,
or making a Text to Speech call.

## Setup

To use the examples you will first need a [Nexmo account][sign-up]. Then rename
the `example.env` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

For some of the examples you will need to [buy a number][buy-number].

## Running the Examples

All the examples run from a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) server.

Install any dependencies:


```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server:

```sh
python server.py
```

Navigate to the appropriate route defined in `server.py` to execute the example.
